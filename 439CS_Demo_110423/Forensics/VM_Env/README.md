caution.zip: Live malware used, hence the name caution. These files are the reverse_shells, meterpreter, and powershell used to establish a connection and persistence. 
unzip_me.zip: These files are the forensics artifacts. Use CSV editor, Text-editor, or TimelineExplorer.exe

## Instructions
- Unzip both archives and follow along during presentation.

## Bash Script
- The bash script will unzip both archives into /opt/dfir, this script will also make you the owner of OPT directory since by default root owns. I tend to store all my tools, scripts and programs here. Feel free to change the script as needed
